    <string name="bio_text">My name is Alexander Portillo. I am 20 years old and in hopes to become an Android Developer. I am currently majoring in Computer Science and also taking the Android Development course at Devslopes. Aside from education, I love going to the gym and playing guitar. I found my passion of playing guitar when I was 10 years of age. I also started going to the gym a year and a half ago. Another thing that I love to do is watch sports. My favorite team in basketball are the Los Angeles Lakers. I try to watch them play every game and currently planning to go to an actual game this year. My favorite football team are the Green Bay Packers just because I have been an Aaron Rodgers fan since a kid. </string>
